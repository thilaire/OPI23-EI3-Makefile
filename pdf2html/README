Action:
-------

Generates series of html's with png's from pdf at arbitrary dpi
with 17*15 oversampling.

Requirements:
-------------

Aladdin ghostscript at "gs" command, libpng. libpng depends on zlib.
Fast machine. It is good to have Aladdin Ghostscript 6.01 as 5.10 usually
crashes on segfault for some pdf documents. When it crashes, it crashes
persistently at the same page.

Installation:
-------------

1)  Download pdf2html.tgz
2)  tar xzvf pdf2html.tgz
3)  cd pdf2html
4)  make
5)  download necessary pdf into current directory, name it <basename>.pdf
6)  Edit pdf2html and setup the variables at the very beginnin to fit your
    needs. page offset is a number which bears the very first page.
7)  Edit index.dir, which will form Contents Index. Format of the line is decimalpage number, where 1
    is always the page of the pdf that comes first, then follows non-decimal-cipher char, and then the comment,
    after the comment a newline. Comment may contain html tags.
8)  pdf2html <the_pdf> [starting_page]. Pages are numbered from 0. When you convert a postscript,
    you cannot use the starting page.
9)  You'll find html in basename*.html, png's in basename*.png. The basename
    as well as many other args can be changed in 6). There will be index.html as a root.
10)  Move the html's and png's into desired place along with left.png, 
    right.png, and up.png.
